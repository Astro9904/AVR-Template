# AVR-Template
A simple template to start an avr project.
Currently only supports C code.

## Prerequisites
This template will only work when used on a windows system with make and the AVR toolchain installed.

## Usage
All code should be placed into the src folder.
Open the makefile to set the parameters options as you need.
To build the project start a CLI and cd to the folder containing the makefile. 
Afterwards simply type make to build the project.
Use make install to upload the hex file to the microcontroller.
